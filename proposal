# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?
"The journey of a football player"

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A choose your own adventure game where you are a high school football player and get your way into the NFL.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will give the user a question or choice and depending on the user's answer, new questions or choice will appear. It will allow the user to go through the motions of being a football player. The features it will have will hopefully include a football-style background with an appealing look for the choices the user has to make. This will be executed by a series of if statements and the use of pictures gor the graphics. 

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

N/A

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

Natalie Kozemchak. Email: natalie.kozemchak@temple.edu

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A choose your own adventure game on python, having the user enter 1 or 2 for the choices

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A choose your own adventure game with clickable choices and a background

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A choose your own adventure game with clickable choices, a background, and appealing graphics.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

We will need to learn how to implement clickable choices. We will also need to learn how to make graphics appear so that the game looks like an app for a phone. We may need to research the process to the NFL in order for accuracy. Natalie and I will most likely collaborate on most parts of this project. We may have one of us do one path of choose your own adventure while the other does another path.
