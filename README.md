The project turned out very well in my eyes. While I ended up keeping the final output on python, I think it was still a great project as I put a lot of details into each of the choices offered and put a lot of time into giving the user many different choices along the way. I believe it ended in almost 3000 lines of code.

I set up the first three choices for the project, developed the storylines, and then coded the storyline for West High.

I ran into some problems along the way with indentation and spelling, but after carefully looking, I was able to fix it.

Even though it took time, I enjoyed putting detail into each of the scenarios, because I enjoy football.

Overall, because I wasn't able to make it visually appealing, I focused all my time and energy into creating detailed storylines and lots of code.
